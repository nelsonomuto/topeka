Topeka
------

There are 2 ways to get your dependencies up-and-running:

### Direct Git:

This is the best way to not be broken. The Polymer team doesn't use bower in day-to-day development and so Topeka might be broken more frequently if you use the Bower-based workflow.

1. Checkout topeka
2. Do the following:

        mkdir components
        cd components
        git clone https://github.com/Polymer/tools.git
        cd ..
        ./components/tools/bin/pull-all.sh #get a copy of all of Polymer

### Bower

  1. Checkout topeka
  2. Make sure you have `npm` and `bower` [installed](http://bower.io/) installed.
  3. `cd topeka`, `bower install`, 'npm install'
  4. `gulp` an express server listening at port 9201 on localhost
